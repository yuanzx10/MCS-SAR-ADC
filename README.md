This is some of the code I used to get the behavior simulation result about the MCS SAR ADC. The simulation results are used in the doucument "Old topics about MCS SAR ADC" written by myself. I didn't put it in here because I don't know that some of conslusion in the material are worth publishing or not.

Anyway, I put the code there, so that the readers may refer to it and may check the correctness of it if possible. This code is run in root-cern, not a pure standard C/C++, but one can find it is easy to adapt it to standard C/C++.
